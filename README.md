This is a scrapy project that is about Scrapy + selenium + ProxyAgent + UserAgent, and using a suprising package called 'CloudScraper' to help me to promote my project.
But unfortunately, I still couldn't make a perfect job, Im guessing that I should use Redis? or not?
I hope that my project could be a reference for someone.
